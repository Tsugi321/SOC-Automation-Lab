# SOC-Automation-Lab

## Objective
Design and implement an end‑to‑end SOC automation workflow using Wazuh, TheHive, and Shuffle to streamline alert handling and accelerate response. The lab will demonstrate how Wazuh detections automatically generate cases in TheHive, trigger Shuffle playbooks to enrich events, notify analysts via automated email workflows, and execute predefined response actions. The goal is to reduce manual triage effort, improve alert fidelity, and showcase automated containment and communication capabilities within a modern SOC environment.
